<!--This module focuses on causal inference, covering methods for establishing cause-and-effect relationships from data.-->

## Course Overview
This course is a fast-paced overview of causal inference, equipping students with the tools and knowledge to analyze and interpret causal relationships from observational and experimental data.

### Key Topics
* **Potential Outcomes Framework:** Introduction to the Rubin Causal Model.
* **Randomization and Observational Studies:** Design and analysis considerations.
* **Confounding and Bias:** Identification and mitigation strategies.
* **Machine Learning:** Overview of some statistically principled methods.
