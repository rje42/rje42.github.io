This Part C, OMMS and MSc module covers graphical models, exploring their theory and applications in statistical analysis.

### Course Overview

This course delves into the principles and applications of graphical models, providing students with a comprehensive understanding of their use in various statistical contexts.

### Material

PDF [lecture notes](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~evans/gms/lecturenotes_24.pdf) are available, as are [online notes](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~evans/gms/_book/).
