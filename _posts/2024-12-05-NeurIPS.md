Dan Manela and Laura Battaglia presented a poster associated with 
[de Vassimon Manela et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01295) (Marginal Causal Flows for Validation and Inference) 
at the [Thirty-Eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2024), 
in Vancouver.  The paper provides a generative method using normalizing flows to 
simulate from causal models under the frugal parameterization.
