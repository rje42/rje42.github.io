Ryan Carey, Marina Maciel Ansanelli, Elie Wolfe, and Robin Evans have [released a paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20433) 
characterizing the _interventional_ equivalence class of directed acyclic graph models 
under both marginalization _and_ selection (or conditioning). 

They show that, unlike for the corresponding model under just marginalization ([mDAGs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.1809)), 
there are subtle differences between the 'single-world' intervention scheme, and weaker
probing schemes ([Ansanelli et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01686)).  They also 
provide a separation criterion that is at least as powerful as m-separation.
