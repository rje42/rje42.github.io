[Linying Yang](https://linyingyang.github.io/) has today shared a manuscript
on [_Outcome-informed_ weighting for robust ATE estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15989).  The
paper, inspired by [Taufiq et al., 2023](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/hash/a51f974947c42b40a40a882a7d9b2479-Abstract-Conference.html),
augments the _marginal ratio_ estimand in that paper in a manner analogous to [augmented inverse 
probability weighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_probability_weighting#Augmented_Inverse_Probability_Weighted_Estimator_(AIPWE)),
securing doubly-robust properties.  

In particular, it can filter out [instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_variables_estimation) 
and spurious variables, and allows for inference that out-performs the original 
marginal ratio.

The work is joint with Robin Evans.
